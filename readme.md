## Description
As semester comes to a close, students are often rushing to clean out their dorms before heading home. Textbooks,
leftover school supplies, and other bells and whistles are often tossed aside without much thought. This is a
Laravel application that will allow users to post the items that they wish to sell, buy other items posted by other
users, view a history of transactions, and get real-time emails of their purchases in the form of a sales receipt.

## Demo
Coming Soon!

## Details for teaching team

1. The 101 Dalmations cartoon/movie is one of my all time favorites and it served as an inspiration for the name of
the site.
2. The site requires user login credentials and the 2 required default ones are set up in the migrations:
    - Name: Jill - Username: jill@harvard.edu - Password: helloworld
    - Name: Jamal - Username: jamal@harvard.edu - Password: helloworld

## Outside code
